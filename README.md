# Welcome to Rat Race!

Rat Race is a non-realtime game based around the pre-existing game Snakes and Ladders. It was built from scratch chiefly using React and Javascript. We chose these languages due to the extensive customisability, animation and user interaction that creating such a game would require.

One of the greatest challenges of this project has been consistently implementing tests. While this can be partially attributed to the time pressure surrounding the project and our relative unfamiliarity with the technologies used, given more time and a second attempt we would certainly place more emphasis on a test driven approach.

Despite this, we're extremely proud of the final product we've achieved, creating our own version of a classic game with several personal touches to differentiate it as our own and we're hugely excited to have you here playing our game.
